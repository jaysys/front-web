To resolve the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issue you're encountering, you need to enable CORS in your FastAPI backend. By default, FastAPI does not allow requests from different origins (like `http://localhost:3000` for your React app and `http://127.0.0.1:8000` for your FastAPI app). You can use the `fastapi.middleware.cors.CORSMiddleware` to resolve this.

### Steps to Enable CORS in FastAPI:

1. **Install `fastapi` and `uvicorn` (if not already installed)**:
   You probably already have these installed, but if not, run:

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

2. **Update your FastAPI app to enable CORS**:
   In your FastAPI `main.py` file, add the following lines to configure CORS:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from typing import Union
from PIL import Image
import io

app = FastAPI()

# Allow CORS from specific origins
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000"],  # React app's origin
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}

@app.post("/getimageinfo/")
async def get_image_info(ImageInfo: UploadFile = File(...)):
    filename = ImageInfo.filename
    contents = await ImageInfo.read()
    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(contents))
    width, height = image.size
    return {
        "filename": filename,
        "width": width,
        "height": height
    }
```

### Explanation:

- **`allow_origins`**: This is where you specify the origins allowed to make requests to the FastAPI app. In your case, it's `http://localhost:3000` for your React app. You can also set it to `["*"]` to allow requests from any origin, but it's generally more secure to restrict it to only your app's domain.
- **`allow_methods`**: This allows all HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.).
- **`allow_headers`**: This allows all headers. If you only want to allow specific headers, you can define them here.

### Restart Your FastAPI Server:

After adding the CORS middleware, restart the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Try the React App Again:

With CORS now enabled, the React app should be able to send the request without being blocked. Test the form again by uploading your image from the React app, and the CORS error should be resolved.

It seems the error is related to an issue with how `File` is being imported and used in your `FastAPI` app. Specifically, the `File` class is not being recognized, which is likely due to a missing or incorrect import.

### Solution:

Ensure that the `UploadFile` and `File` classes are properly imported from `fastapi`. Update the `main.py` file to include these necessary imports.

### Corrected `main.py` file:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from PIL import Image
import io

app = FastAPI()

# CORS configuration
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000"],  # React app's origin
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}

@app.post("/getimageinfo/")
async def get_image_info(ImageInfo: UploadFile = File(...)):
    filename = ImageInfo.filename
    contents = await ImageInfo.read()
    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(contents))
    width, height = image.size
    return {
        "filename": filename,
        "width": width,
        "height": height
    }
```

### Key Changes:

- I added the missing `File` and `UploadFile` imports from `fastapi`:
  ```python
  from fastapi import UploadFile, File
  ```

### Next Steps:

1. **Restart your FastAPI server**:
   After making these changes, try restarting your server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Test the application again**:
   Now, it should work without any import-related errors.
